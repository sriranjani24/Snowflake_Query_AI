# Snowflake AI Toolkit

Snowflake AI Toolkit is an AI Accelerator and Playground for enabling AI in Snowflake. It is an Plug and Play Streamlit based Native App that can be used to explore, learn and build rapid prototypes of AI Solutions in Snowflake powered by the Snowflake's Cortex and AI Functions.

# Features

### Playground

An interactive environment where users can chat and experiment with Snowflake Cortex functions, test prompts, and and play around with cortex functions.

### Build

A dedicated section for constructing and deploying data pipelines and workflows using Snowflake Cortex's powerful AI capabilities, enabling seamless integration with your Snowflake databases and tables

- Text completion and generation using the COMPLETE function
- Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) for question answering with your own data
- Fine-tuning large language models on your custom datasets

### Search

Get a hybrid (vector and keyword) search engine on your text data in minutes,

- Create and manage Cortex Search Service
- Use Cortex Search for your RAG Application
- Use Cortex Search Powered Chat

### Agent

Cortex Agents orchestrate across both structured and unstructured data sources to deliver insights.

- Create and Manage Cortex Agent Instances
- Test the Agent against the Data
- Utilize Cortex Search and Cortex Analyst through Agents

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

- **Snowflake Account**: Ensure you have an active Snowflake account in a region where Cortex functionalities are supported. For detailed information, refer to the [Availability Region documentation](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/snowflake-cortex/llm-functions#availability).
- **Private Preview Access**: To try private preview models in Snowflake, you need to contact your Snowflake account team to request access to the private preview feature.
- **Role Permissions**: ACCOUNTADMIN or equivalent role with permissions to create:
  - Stages
  - Databases
  - Other resources
- **Python**: Version 3.7 or higher.
- **Streamlit**: Installed on your local machine.
- **Snowflake-CLI** : Install snowflake-cli through pip
- **Model Availability**: `claude-4-sonnet` and `claude-4-opus` is available only in AWS US (cross-region).

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/sgsshankar/Snowflake-AI-Toolkit.git
   cd snowflake-ai-toolkit
   ```

2. Install dependencies (only required for local development):

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

   All necessary libraries are listed in `requirements.txt`.

## Setup

The application will automatically handle:

- Database creation
- Stage setup
- Required resource initialization

Make sure your Snowflake role has the necessary privileges for these operations.

To configure the application mode, update the `mode` parameter in `src/settings_config.json`:

- Set to `"debug"` for local development and editing.
- Set to `"native"` for running natively in Snowflake.

### Authentication for Cortex Agent – JWT Token Support Only

This app currently supports **only JWT-based authentication** using RSA key pairs for Cortex Agents. OAuth is **not supported** at this time.

#### Step 1: Generate RSA Key Pair

```bash
openssl genrsa 2048 | openssl pkcs8 -topk8 -inform PEM -out rsa_private_key.p8 -nocrypt
openssl rsa -in rsa_private_key.p8 -pubout -out rsa_public_key.pub
```

#### Step 2: Upload Public Key to Snowflake

1. Copy the content from `rsa_public_key.pub` (exclude `-----BEGIN PUBLIC KEY-----` headers).
2. In Snowflake, run:

```sql
alter user <your_username> set rsa_public_key='<paste_public_key_here>';
```

3. Retrieve the public key fingerprint:

```sql
desc user <your_username>;
```

Use the fingerprint in `rsa_public_key_fp`.

#### Step 3: Add to `settings_config.json`

- Paste full contents of `rsa_private_key.p8` into `rsa_private_key` (add \n).
- Paste fingerprint into `rsa_public_key_fp`.

For more details, refer to the [Snowflake documentation](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/key-pair-auth.html#using-key-pair-authentication).

## Running the App

### Locally

Launch the application locally using:

```bash
streamlit run streamlit_app.py
```

### Natively on Snowflake

To deploy the application natively in Snowflake, use the following command:

```bash
snow streamlit deploy --account "<your_account>" --user "<your_username>" --password "<your_password>" --role "<your_role>" --warehouse "<your_warehouse>" --database "<your_database>" --replace
```

Replace the placeholders (`<your_account>`, `<your_username>`, etc.) with your actual Snowflake account details. When running natively in Snowflake, installing dependencies from `requirements.txt` is not needed.

## Troubleshooting

Common issues and solutions:

1. **Snowflake Permission Errors**

   - Verify role privileges for database and stage creation
   - Ensure Cortex functionalities are enabled

2. **Dependency Issues**

   - If pandas/pyarrow installation fails:
     ```bash
     pip install pandas pyarrow
     ```

3. **Connection Issues**
   - Verify Snowflake account credentials
   - Check network connectivity
   - Ensure proper role assignments
